Problem 1
A dependency relationship (max. 2 points): 2
An inheritance relationship  (max. 2 points): 2
An attribute (max. 2 points): 2
An 1 : n aggregation (max. 2 points): 2
An aggregation that is not 1 : n  (max. 2 points): 2

Problem 2
6 object nodes, including seq1, seq2, seq (max. 2 points): 1
3 have type ? implements IntSequence (max. 2 points):2
2 have type ? implements Iterator<Integer> (max. 2 points):0
alternate from IntSeqTest to seq1? (max. 1 point): 1
<<create>> from seq1 to seq (max. 1 point): 0

create arrow needs to point to object

next from IntSeqTest to seq (max. 1 point):1
next from seq to seq1, hasNext, next from seq1 to seq1.iter  (max. 2 points):1
next from IntSeqTest to seq (max. 1 point):1
next from seq to seq2, hasNext, next from seq2 to seq2.iter  (max. 2 points):1

Problem 3

test returns binarySearch(...) >= 0 (max. 2 points):0
clear only if binarySearch >= 0 (max. 1 point): 0
clear calls arrayCopy(..., old elementCount - p  - 1) (max. 2 points): 0
clear decrements elementCount (max. 1 point): 0
set only if binarySearch < 0 (max. 1 point): 0
set calls arrayCopy(..., old elementCount - p) (max. 2 points):2
set increments elementCount (max. 1 point): 1
set works for empty array (max. 1 point): 1
array relocated if full (max. 2 point):2
smallest/largest removed (max. 2 points): 0

Problem 4

Use @Test (max. 2 points): 2
import Test, Assert (max. 2 points):2
Test case calling set, clear, test (max. 3 points):3
Test case calling set, clear, looking into elements (max. 3 points):3

Problem 5

No work

Aggregate none, with explanation  (max. 2 points): 0
ConcreteAggregate InputStream, String, File  (max. 2 points): 0
Iterator Iterator<String> (max. 1 point): 0
ConcreteIterator Scanner (max. 1 point): 0
createIterator() new Scanner(...)  (max. 1 point): 0
next() next() (max. 1 point): 0
isDone() opposite of hasNext() (max. 1 point): 0
currentItem() Return value of next() (max. 1 point): 0

Problem 1
2 subclasses (max. 2 points):2
2 concrete methods (max. 2 points):2
The "algorithm/templateMethod()" is to compute byte/short values (max. 2 points):2

The abstract class is Number, the concrete classes are Integer, Double, ... (max. 2 points): 0

Problem 2

Decorator

Component              | MoveableShape (max. 2 points): 2
ConcreteComponent      | e.g. CarShape (max. 2 points): 2
Decorator              | BoxedShape    (max. 2 points): 2
method()               | draw, move, getBounds (max. 2 points): 1

Composite

Primitive              | MoveableShape (max. 2 points): 2
Composite              | CompoundShape (max. 2 points): 2
Leaf                   | e.g. CarShape (max. 2 points): 2
method()               | draw, move, getBounds (max. 2 points): 1


Strategy

Context                | Animation     (max. 2 points): 2
Strategy               | MoveStrategy  (max. 2 points): 2
ConcreteStrategy       | e.g. BoundedMoveStrategy  (max. 2 points): 2

getBounds from mouse listener to circle node     (max. 2 points):0
repaint from mouse listener to graph panel       (max. 2 points):1
paintComponent from blank object to graph panel  (max. 2 points):2
getBounds self call on graph panel               (max. 2 points):0
getBounds from graph panel to graph              (max. 2 points):0
getBounds from graph panel to circle node        (max. 2 points):0
drawGrabber self call on graph panel             (max. 2 points):2

No work for below

Decorator pattern doesn't apply                  (max. 2 points):0
No decorator class
Template method pattern doesn't apply            (max. 2 points):0
No primitive operations in subclasses

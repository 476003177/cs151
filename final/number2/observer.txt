This is an example of the observer pattern. The button is the subject an maintains a collection of observers. Observers can attach themselves to the subject with the setOnAction(Observer o) method. The subbject notifies the observers with the handle(ActionEvent e) method when an event occurs. The observer interface is called EventHandler<T>. and in this case the concrete observer is created as "new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
    @Override public void handle(ActionEvent e) {
        // Do something in response to button click
    }
}".
